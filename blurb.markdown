Javascript Test Automation
==========================

Increasingly, web-application behaviour is split between logic running on the server, and Javascript logic running in the browser.  Automated testing of the server-side component is fairly common, but too often the browser-side logic is left out in the cold.

In this presentation we will explain WHY you should test your Javascript code, WHAT to test, and HOW to go about it.  We'll talk about browser-based "functional" tests, as well as true "unit" tests, and explain where each are appropriate.  We'll discuss integration of your tests into an automated build.  You'll leave with a burning desire to try it out on your own projects.
